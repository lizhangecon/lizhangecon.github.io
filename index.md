## Welcome to my page!

Hi, I am Li Zhang (张力), a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [Centre for Research and Analysis of Migration](https://cream-migration.org) (CReAM), University College London. I received my Ph.D. in Economics from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.econ.cuhk.edu.hk) (CUHK) and my Bachelor's and Master's Degrees in Economics from [Renmin University of China](https://ae.ruc.edu.cn) (RUC).

My research interests lie in labor economics, development economics, and economics of education. 
    
In the 2025-26 academic year, I will be a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [ROCKWOOL Foundation Berlin](https://www.rfberlin.com) (RFBerlin).
