      <font size = 3>This paper studies the impacts of China's dual-credit policy (joint management of fuel consumption and new energy vehicle credits) on the electrification of the auto industry. Using a heterogeneous-firm model, newly assembled data, and difference-in-differences designs, we establish several findings. First, the policy significantly lowers the relative price of electric vehicles (EVs) compared with gasoline vehicles (GVs). Second, small firms reduce GV production to avoid credit obligations, while larger firms relatively increase it. Third, fuel economy improvement slows as EV production serves as a substitute compliance strategy. Fourth, cannibalization effect discourages incumbents to produce high-quality EVs while newcomers offer superior products. Fifth, innovation shifts toward EV and intelligence-related technologies, weakening path dependence. Finally, EV-focused firms hire more skilled labor and cluster in the most developed regions. Our findings highlight the positive role of the dual-credit policy in directing technical change towards electrification.</font>

      <summary>Abstract</summary>
      <font size = 3>We study the wage gap between internal migrants and native workers in China's urban labor market. Using employer-employee-linked administrative records from a large city, we estimate a two-way fixed effects model and decompose the average migrant-native wage gap. Compared to natives with the same skills, migrants receive lower pay from the same employers and are less likely to be employed by high-premium employers. These wage setting and sorting effects contribute to an 8.7-log-point wage penalty for migrants. We then study the role of employer-sponsored hukou (household registration) quotas in determining the wage gap. Following a policy change that decreased the number of quotas by 40%, migrants' wages relative to natives increased by 5.3 log points. The decrease in quotas reduced workplace amenities for migrants, whose earnings increased relative to natives as predicted by the theory of compensating wage differentials. This rise in the wage-setting effect was especially notable among the young, the skilled, and those in the private sector. The quota tightening also induced high-skilled migrants to shift towards the public sector, which was less affected by the quota reduction but on average paid a lower wage premium, and hence, the sorting effect worsened for the migrants. Based on a wage-posting model, we estimate the willingness-to-pay for a quota to be between 2.2 and 3.7 times the average annual earnings.</font>

      <summary>Abstract</summary>
      <font size = 3>This paper examines the impact of innovation on migration patterns across skill groups, taking into account labor market, housing market, and amenity responses. Utilizing data from the Chinese Census spanning 2005 to 2015, we find that cities experiencing higher patent growth attract more low-skilled migrants than high-skilled migrants, a pattern that contrasts with findings from other developed countries. These cities also exhibit stronger wage growth for both low- and high-skilled workers, but not faster growth in amenities. To interpret these empirical results, we develop and estimate a spatial equilibrium model. Our analysis indicates that low-skilled workers prioritize wages more highly, whereas high-skilled workers place greater value on amenities. Furthermore, a higher proportion of skilled workers in a city increases the local supply of amenities. As a result, a positive shock to patent activity draws in more low-skilled than high-skilled workers. This then leads to a reduction in amenities, and thereby further discourages high-skilled migration. Counterfactual analysis suggests that technological growth in China has substantially increased wages and welfare for both low-skilled and high-skilled workers. In general, we find that the growth in China in the last decade did not lead to spatial divergence.</font>

      <font size = 3>The impact of elite education on academic outcomes is a topic of much debate. Utilizing the discontinuity in enrollment probability around the enrollment thresholds in the high school entrance exams, this study estimates the heterogeneous effect of elite high schools on the college entrance exam results for students with different levels of academic preparation measured by their previous academic performance. Academically well-prepared students significantly benefit more from elite high schools than under-prepared students. Peer effects partially explain the heterogeneous effect. The results imply potential misallocation of resources when using one-shot high-stakes exams to allocate educational resources.</font>

5. [Trade Liberalization and Intergenerational Education Mobility: Evidence from China](https://ssrn.com/abstract=5274377) (with [Jingxuan Du](https://sites.google.com/view/dujingxuan/home)). Revision requested by _**Labour Economics**_.

      <summary>Abstract</summary>
      <font size = 3>This study examines the impact of trade liberalization on intergenerational education mobility, focusing on China’s accession to the WTO. The negative impact of export tariff reduction on educational outcomes is greater for children from low-educated families than for those from high-educated families, resulting in reduced intergenerational education mobility. Estimations of intergenerational education elasticity also support this finding. This study proposes that the opportunity cost of education alone cannot explain the results and documents another non-negligible mechanism: parents’ time inputs. Parents may reduce their time and effort on children’s education to take new job opportunities created by trade liberalization, negatively affecting children’s early childhood development.</font>

6. Rural Labor Allocation, Risk Insurance, and Temporary Migration (with [Yucheng Wang](https://yuchengwang.weebly.com))[[slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TapCu4obIzGvAJnSSiCJqqbBiqPV9Nfb/view?usp=sharing)]

      <summary>Abstract</summary>
      <font size = 3>Migration risks are an important barrier holding rural households back from allocating labor to urban areas. Existing literature suggests that rural households have better insurance against productivity risks and emphasizes the informal insurance network as a channel. This paper proposes local labor allocation as an alternative channel, highlighting the importance of diversified labor income sources and labor supply flexibility. Using unique and rich longitudinal data on rural households in China, we develop a formal test examining how rural households respond to both aggregate and idiosyncratic shocks and the role of migration in the risk-transmission process. 60.9% of risk insurance occurs during the transmission of agriculture income shock to total labor income, while the transmission of income shock to consumption accounts for 39.1%. This confirms that rural households respond to agricultural shocks by adjusting local labor allocation. We further support the results using annual fluctuations in weather as an exogenous agricultural productivity shock. Based on the empirical findings, we develop a dynamic model of location choice, sectoral labor allocation, and asset accumulation with borrowing constraints. We use the model to study the welfare effects of reducing moving barriers and relaxing borrowing constraints.</font>

      <summary>Abstract</summary>
      <font size = 3>Many households are confined to remote rural villages in the developing world. This study examines the Anti-Poverty Relocation Program in China, considering the village-to-town relocation from agricultural to non-agricultural sectors induced by the program. While exploring a novel administrative data set on impoverished people in a Chinese county, we discovered that the program significantly increased the participants’ income by 9.61%, driven mainly by the increase in wage income. The empirical findings are consistent with the Roy-model perspective, which states that rural households with comparative advantage in non-agricultural sectors could benefit from relocation to nearby towns. This study provides new evidence that mobility barriers across sectors exist even on a small geographic scale in rural areas. The results of the cost–benefit analysis suggest that relocation of households in remote rural areas is a feasible policy tool for overcoming such mobility barriers.</font>
