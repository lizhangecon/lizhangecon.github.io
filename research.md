      <font size = 3>This study examines the factors contributing to the wage gap between migrants and natives, as well as the influence of internal mobility constraints on this gap. Using matched employer-employee panel data from a Chinese metropolis between 2006 and 2014, we estimate a two-way fixed effect wage model following Abowd, Kramarz, and Margolis (1999). Our decomposition analysis reveals that migrants tend to earn lower wages within the same employer and are less likely to be employed by companies offering high wage premiums. These two factors combined account for a 10 percentage-point difference in average wages between migrants and natives. Additionally, we investigate the impact of a policy change that restricted the "hukou" (household registration) quota to understand the mechanisms underlying the migrant-native wage gap. Following a one-third reduction in hukou quotas, we observe a narrowing of the negative wage gap, particularly in the private sector where significant quota reductions occurred, and among young migrants who have a higher demand for hukou. This effect is mainly driven by an increase in the wage premium paid by employers due to the unavailability of hukou. However, the shortage of hukou quotas exacerbates the misallocation of workers, making high-ability individuals more likely to work in low-productivity public sectors.</font>

      <summary>Abstract</summary>
      <font size = 3>A large and growing literature focuses on the causal impacts of elite education on students’ academic outcomes. Yet, current conclusions are contentious. To understand the heterogeneous impacts of elite education, this study utilizes a new empirical strategy based on the fact that the one-shot high school entrance exam (HSEE) in China generates sufficient variation in the academic ability of students even in a narrow bandwidth around the admission cutoff of entering elite high schools. Combining students’ performance on middle school final exams, the HSEE, and the college entrance exam (CEE) in a typical county in China, this study provides direct evidence that well-prepared students benefit more from elite high school education compared to under-prepared students. Peer effects partially explain the heterogeneous effect. Additionally, high-stakes exam results depend highly on one’s unobserved ability to handle such exams. These findings imply that using one-shot high-stakes exam results to allocate educational resources masks students’ actual preparation for elite education, resulting in a misallocation of educational resources.</font>

3. Rural Labor Allocation, Risk Insurance, and Temporary Migration (with [Yucheng Wang](https://yuchengwang.weebly.com))[[slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TapCu4obIzGvAJnSSiCJqqbBiqPV9Nfb/view?usp=sharing)] _New draft coming soon!_

      <summary>Abstract</summary>
      <font size = 3>Migration risks are an important barrier holding rural households back from allocating labor to urban areas. Existing literature suggests that rural households have better insurance against productivity risks and emphasizes the informal insurance network as a channel. This paper proposes local labor allocation as an alternative channel, highlighting the importance of diversified labor income sources and labor supply flexibility. Using unique and rich longitudinal data on rural households in China, we develop a formal test examining how rural households respond to both aggregate and idiosyncratic shocks and the role of migration in the risk-transmission process. 60.9% of risk insurance occurs during the transmission of agriculture income shock to total labor income, while the transmission of income shock to consumption accounts for 39.1%. This confirms that rural households respond to agricultural shocks by adjusting local labor allocation. We further support the results using annual fluctuations in weather as an exogenous agricultural productivity shock. Based on the empirical findings, we develop a dynamic model of location choice, sectoral labor allocation, and asset accumulation with borrowing constraints. We use the model to study the welfare effects of reducing moving barriers and relaxing borrowing constraints.</font>

4. Trade Liberalization and Intergenerational Education Mobility: Evidence from China (with Jingxuan Du)[[slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JthHzQEYFj9nMq0nu-ZMWESnb-nue5kV/view?usp=sharing)] _New draft coming soon!_

      <summary>Abstract</summary>
      <font size = 3>This study examines the impact of trade liberalization on intergenerational education mobility, focusing on China’s accession to the WTO. The negative impact of export tariff reduction on educational outcomes is greater for children from low-educated families than for those from high-educated families, resulting in reduced intergenerational education mobility. Estimations of intergenerational education elasticity also support this finding. This study proposes that the opportunity cost of education alone cannot explain the results and documents another non-negligible mechanism: parents’ time inputs. Parents may reduce their time and effort on children’s education to take new job opportunities created by trade liberalization, negatively affecting children’s early childhood development.</font>

      <font size = 3>Many households are confined to remote rural villages in the developing world. This study examines the Anti-Poverty Relocation Program in China, considering the village-to-town relocation from agricultural to non-agricultural sectors induced by the program. While exploring a novel administrative data set on impoverished people in a Chinese county, we discovered that the program significantly increased the participants’ income by 9.61%, driven mainly by the increase in wage income. The empirical findings are consistent with the Roy-model perspective, which states that rural households with comparative advantage in non-agricultural sectors could benefit from relocation to nearby towns. This study provides new evidence that mobility barriers across sectors exist even on a small geographic scale in rural areas. The results of the cost–benefit analysis suggest that relocation of households in remote rural areas is a feasible policy tool for overcoming such mobility barriers.</font>
